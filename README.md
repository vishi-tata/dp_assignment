## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
- Upvote and downvote comments
- **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
- **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-First workflow

### What I learned

The major learning for me is using Grid efficiently especially grid area.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

The project can be further expanded to add a login functionality so that users can switch. It can also add support for media like images, emojis etc.

### Useful resources

- [Element: insertAdjacentHTML() method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/insertAdjacentHTML) - Generating HTML content on the fly and adding them to the DOM was made easy with this method
